I'm Danish, a software engineering student at the University of Alberta. Currently, I'm working
as an intern at [Honey](https://www.joinhoney.com/) in Los Angeles, CA.

I've previously interned at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) in Vancouver, BC where I worked on
a developer productivity tool and [Green Brick Labs](https://www.greenbricklabs.com/) in Waterloo, ON
where I worked on the Identity provider and API gateway for their core product.

I am a product-oriented developer with a passion for hacking productivity through software. I also
love working with large scale systems and would love to be a part of a services/infrastructure team.

I'm always looking for challenging opportunities and collaboration opportunities, would love to talk to
you over [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/dandua98) or email at [danish@dandua.com](mailto:danish@dandua.com)
